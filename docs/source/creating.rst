Importing Subtitles from an External File
-------------------------------------------

If you already have your subtitles typed out in a text file (e.g., Notepad), you can import the file into Jubler.


1. To locate the external file, click the **Load Screen** button at the top of the interface.
2. In the window that appears, select the file you want to upload.
3. To confirm the selection, click **Open**. The subtitles will now appear in the interface.


Importing and Adjusting the Appearance of your Video and Audio file
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Click on the eye button.
2. To choose your movie file, click **Browse** to the right of the text field.
3. To use another audio file (rather than the one that comes with your video), check the box titled “**Use a different audio stream.**” A pop-up window will appear from where you can select your alternate audio file. Otherwise, leave the box unchecked.
4. To confirm your selection, click **OK**. The movie will now appear in the Jubler interface.

.. admonition:: Remember!
   
   By default, the audio track is also displayed with the video preview. Jubler needs to be in full screen for the video and audio track to be displayed side-by-side.
